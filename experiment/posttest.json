      "question": "The angle subtended at the centre of the directing circle is calculated by the formula ____.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "(r/R) × 180°",
        "b": "(R/r) × 360°",
        "c": "(r/R) × 360°",
        "d": "(R/r) × 180°"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The angle subtended at the center is given by (r/R) × 360°, where r is the radius of the generating circle and R is the radius of the directing circle."

        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {

    {
      "question": "If the diameter of the directing circle is doubled the diameter of the generating circle then the hypocycloid will become a ______.",

        "b": "Line",
        "c": "Epicycloid",
        "d": "Circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "When the generating circle is half the size of the directing circle, the resulting hypocycloid is a straight line."

        "c": "72°",
        "d": "90°"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Using the formula: (r/R) × 360° = (30/150) × 360 = 72°."
